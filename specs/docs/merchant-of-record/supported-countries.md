# Supported countries

### Payments & Merchant of Record

We support payments globally except from countries with US sanctions (Cuba, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Syria).

As your Merchant of Record (MoR) we take on the [liability for international sales taxes](/docs/merchant-of-record/introduction).

### Payouts

Polar uses Stripe Connect Express to issue payouts to residents or businesses in any of the countries below. See [Payout Accounts](/docs/features/finance/accounts) for how to connect one.

<Note>
  **FAQ: Stripe isn't available in my country. Can I still use Polar?**

  As the Merchant of Record, Polar takes care of charging customers, so Stripe Payments doesn't need to be available in your country. All you need is to be in a country supported by Stripe Connect Express to receive payouts.

  Stripe Connect Express country coverage is much broader, and includes everywhere listed below.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Polar in countries (e.g. India) where Stripe is invite-only?">
    <Note>Stripe Connect Express is a different product than the regular Stripe payments.</Note>
    Yes, any individual or company operating in our [supported countries](/docs/merchant-of-record/supported-countries) can receive payouts from Polar even if Stripe standalone is invite-only there.

    This is possible as Polar is the Merchant of Record, all payments from customers are made to Polar (US). [Stripe Connect Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts) is then used to issue payouts, and is supported in more countries via cross-border transfer than Stripe Payments standalone.

    You might still see a warning in Stripe Connect Express that payments are invite-only, but don't worry. No direct sales are made directly to the Stripe Connect Express account. They're all made to Polar (US) as a platform and the merchant of record. We only use the transfer and payout feature of Stripe Connect Express which is available in all of our [supported countries](/docs/merchant-of-record/supported-countries).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Polar as an individual to make sales globally?">
    Yes, given that Stripe Connect Express supports individual as a business type in your region.

    To know which business type is supported in your country, follow steps as below:

    * Open required [verification information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information#US+RS+express+recipient+individual+transfers) by Stripe to set up a business or personal account in your country.
    * Ensure `Platform Country` is set to `United States (US)`.
    * Ensure `Dashboard Type` is set to `express`.
    * Ensure `Service Agreement` is set to `recipient`.
    * Ensure `Capability` is set to `transfers`.
    * Select the correct `Account Country` relevant to you.
    * Click on the toggle for `Business Type` which will allow you know if individual, business, company or LLC/LLP is supported by Stripe Connect Express in that region.
